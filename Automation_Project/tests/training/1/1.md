This workflow sets a global delay macro at the top of the file using #GlobalDelay with a value of 200ms, meaning that a 200ms sleep will be inserted after 
every statement for the entire program. This is to provide leeway to reduce inconsistency in execution time.
DirCreate is used to create a directory at the target path. If a directory at the path exists, it is overwritten. 
FileCreate creates a new file at the path, and it also overwrites existing any existing file. 
Run "wordpad.exe" launches the wordpad program. 
In a for loop with 5 iterations, WriteLine writes "hello world" to the wordpad editor.
SaveAs saves the current working file by entering ctrl+s keyboard shortcut to the program, saving the file to the given path, overwriting existing files.
Close kills the window in focus.
Del deletes the file or directory at the path given.
